     <li>Brandon to focus on initial data markup <!--Tyler/Patrick can also assist in markup once more data arrives - language barrier not an issue with significant portion of markup</li>
     <lie>Zac to focus on ODD initially; get it started then hand it back to group</ol></ol>
  <li>TEI elements</li>
  <ol><li>Potential elements for the ODD?</li>
  <ol><li>Brandon to push potential markups codes</li>
    <li>abbr used to mark abbreviated text/textspeak...ex: vc instead of voce</li>
    <li>sic used to mark errors <!--potential attribute to note type? i.e grammar or spelling?--></li>

    <li>BRIEF ABSTRACT: We are analyzing interactions between American students of Portuguese and Brazilian Portuguese L1 speakers via a communication application. Conversations will be tracked for texting convetions such as punctuation, emoji use, and abbreviations. Errors made by the Portuguese learners will also be tracked in addition to corrections made by the native Brazilian students.</li>
   <li>Also discussed potential marking significant gaps in reponse time; acknowledging that we do have limitted data at the time, we observed that the American student occassionally 'abandoned' the conversation which had to be reinitiated by the Brazilian</li>
   <li>For the time being, we will focus on the website and markup of exisiting data for the Midterm and eagerly await new data as there were some difficulties acquiring more from the professor</li>
