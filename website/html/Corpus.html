            <p>The corpus for this project is being gathered from screen shots sent to the
                reasearchers from participants within the conversations themselves. Since the
                texting is being done between two students, the easiest and most efficient method
                for the documentation of the discourse is to transcribe the screen shots. We have
                many images that will be/have been transcribed so as to make the text more
                accessible.</p>
            <p> We'll include a picture or two to show what sort of text we were originally dealing with.</p>
