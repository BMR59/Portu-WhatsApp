            <p>This project seeks to analyze written Portuguese conversations between American and
                Brazilian students. Conversations took place on WhatsApp, an application which
                provides text-messaging services, and were gathered by Professor Ana Paula Carvalho
                for her own research through the Projeto Bate-Papo Cultural, a project of the
                Portuguese Conversation course at the University of Pittsburgh. Students provided
                screenshots of their conversations with their assigned Brazilian "language
                partners", which were then transcribed and coded according to TEI standards. The
                objective was to note for linguistic and cultural phenomena, such as: texting
                conventions (abbreviated forms, non-obligatory contractions, punctuation), informal
                language, use of emojis, laughter, and errors and corrections.</p>
