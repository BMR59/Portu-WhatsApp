<g>* There is a section for 'glyphs' in the header which will detail the type of emoji or smiley used. For exmaple, :) would be <g ref="#ms">:)</g> 
(ms stands for MANUAL SMILEY) 

Unsure how to track laughter - appropriate element which can be nested inside <u> is necessary

Clarify <abbr type=""> when use for pra and pro:
In speech, the full word "para" is often pronounced "pra" 

Para + a and Para + o becomes pra and pro in speech (this is extremely common, not mandatory per se but expected in speech but too informal for writing)

PARA + VERB =/= PRA - so this <em>could</em> be marked as an error but given the informal nature of texting I'm marking as an <abbr> but for the value of @type being "informal" ?

PRA and PRO before a noun I'm marking as <abbr type="textese">
