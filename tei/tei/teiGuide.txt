 <text>
  <body>
   <u who="#">
    <abbr type="informal"> - forms like 'tava' instead of 'estava'; pra for para

*<sic> would need to be modified to permit a 'type' attribute  
*<kinesic> would need to be modified to permit an attribute as well as to allow text within the element
    styles of laughter are: rsrs and kkkk (Brazilian) or lol and hahah (American)
      Good attribute to mark these values? Or stick with a 'type' attribute? 

<!--These are the elements being used and explanations behind them.
   <u who="#">
    <abbr type="informal">
This marks forms that are common in speech, but are perscriptively "forbidden" in writing. Ex/ "tava" in place of "estava" or "pra+verbo" in place of "para+verbo".
    <abbr type="textese">
These are strictly texting conventions such as: "td" for "tudo"; "vc" for "voce"; "n" for "nao" and so on.
    <abbr type="contraction">
This marks 'non-grammatical' contractions which are acceptable in speech but not formal writing: para+o=pro; para+a=pra; nao+e'=ne'
    <sic type="corrected">
Marks and error which was orrected by the Brazilian
    <sic type="uncorrected">
Marks an error which was uncorrected by the Brazilian
    <corr type="explicit">
The Brazilian directly corrects the error. Ex/ "That verb doesn't fit in that sentence, what you could say is..."
    <corr type="implicit">
The Brazilian indirectly corrects the error by using the correct form in a response but without mentioning that an error had been made.
Ex/ American: Estou *no* universidade     Brazilian: Estou *na* *minha* universidade, tambe'm.
    <pc type="exclamative" n="">
Excalamation marks and amount being used.
    <pc type="interrogative" n="">
Question marks and the amount being used.
    <foreign xml:lang="">
Options are "en" and "sp" for when speakers write a word in English or Spanish. This can be nested within the <sic> element
    <emph>
Potential way of marking laughter? Also: potentially use an @ to signify 'american' (lol; hahaha) vs. 'brazilian' (kkkk; rsrs) laughter
    <g ref="#"/>
Empty element used for marking emojis. Emoji codes can be found in the TEI header.
    <g ref="#"></g>
Used to makr 'manual' smiley such as: :) :( :/
   </u>

<damage/>
Empty element nested underneath the <body> element for whenever part of the text has been obscured or omitted.


<!--Unsure how to track laughter - appropriate element which can be nested inside <u> is necessary-->

<!--
Clarification of the markup of PRA, which differs dependent on how it is used:
In Portuguese, 'PARA' can be used a number of ways, most commonly as 'to' or 'in order to'.
In speech, 'PARA' is often shortened to 'PRA' - this is strictly colloquial and considered improper in terms of writing
  In informal texting, 'PRA' is used often.

Also in speech, 'PARA' contracts with the definite article 'O' and 'A' and becomes 'PRO' or 'PRA', respectively.
 This is also considered a convention of speech and not permitted in formal writing, but it is used informally in texting.

So, 'PRA' before a verb or pronoun is mark as <abbr type="informal"> as it is an informal method of speech which has surfaced in texting.

'PRO/PRA' used before nouns, proper or not, is marked as <abbr type="contraction"> as it is an 'ungrammatical' contraction
